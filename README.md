# Otto Roadmap

-1st level: there are about 33 models that we used their predictions as meta features for the 2nd level, also there are 8 engineered features.

-2nd level: there are 3 models trained using 33 meta features + 7 features from 1st level: XGBOOST, Neural Network(NN) and ADABOOST with ExtraTrees.

-3rd level: it's composed by a weighted mean of 2nd level predictions.
All models in 1st layers are trained using a 5 fold cross-validation technique using always the same fold indices.

The 2nd level we trainned using 4 Kfold random indices. It provided us the ability to calculate the score before submitting to the leader board. All our cross-validate scores are extremely correlated with LB scores, so we have a good estimate of performance locally and it enabled us the ability to discard useless models for the 2nd learning level.
Models and features used for 2nd level training:

+ Feature 6: Clustering features of original dataset
+ Feature 7: Number of non-zeros elements in each row
+ Feature 8: X (That feature was used only in NN 2nd level training)

The 2nd level we start training cross-validated just to choose best models, tune hyperparameters and find optimum weights to average 3rd level.
After we found some good parameters, we trained 2nd level using entire trainset and bagged results.
The final model is a very stable 2nd level bagging of:
XGBOOST: 250 runs.
NN: 600 runs.
ADABOOST: 250 runs.
The average for the 3rd level we found better using a geometric mean of XGBOOST and NN. For ET we did an aritmetic mean with previous result: 0.85 * [XGBOOST^0.65 * NN^0.35] + 0.15 * [ET].
